# Two-lead-joint-detection-of-QRS-complexes-in-ECG
QRS complex in ECG signal is detected by two leads. The main idea is: first, roughly detect the peak on the leading lead, and then search for the peak at the corresponding position on the auxiliary lead for confirmation, so as to improve the detection probability.
